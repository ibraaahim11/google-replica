# Google Search Replica  

This is a dark-mode replica of Google’s search interface, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** for styling and responsiveness. The project includes three main pages and aims to mimic Google’s clean, minimalistic design with a touch of dark mode.  

## Features  
- **Google Search Page**  
  - A centered search bar with rounded corners.  
  - Buttons for "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky."  
  - A dark-mode aesthetic to give it a modern vibe.  
  - Links to the Image Search and Advanced Search pages in the top-right corner.  

- **Google Image Search Page**  
  - A search bar that redirects users to Google Image search results.  
  - Consistent dark-mode styling with navigation links to other pages.  

- **Google Advanced Search Page**  
  - Four fields to input specific query options:
    - All these words.  
    - This exact word or phrase.  
    - Any of these words.  
    - None of these words.  
  - A blue "Advanced Search" button styled using Bootstrap.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **HTML**: Structuring the content.  
- **CSS**: Custom styles to replicate Google’s aesthetic in dark mode.  
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and consistent UI elements.  

## How It Works  
- The search bars on all pages redirect users to actual Google search results.  
- The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the main page takes users directly to the first Google result for their query.
